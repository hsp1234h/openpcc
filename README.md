# OpenPCC

OpenPCC is an open-source framework for provably private AI inference, inspired by Apple’s Private Cloud Compute but fully open, auditable, and deployable on your own infrastructure. It allows anyone to run open or custom AI models without exposing prompts, outputs, or logs - enforcing privacy with encrypted streaming, hardware attestation, and unlinkable requests.

OpenPCC is designed to become a transparent, community-governed standard for AI data privacy.
